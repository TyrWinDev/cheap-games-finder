**(Project is still WIP, so things may change)**

**About the App:**

Welcome to my gaming discovery application repository, crafted using React and Node.js. This repository houses the code for an application that amalgamates the capabilities of the RAWG API, CheapShark API, and YouTube API to provide the user with all the information required when buying cheap PC games.

**Key Technical Features:**

**API Integration for Price Tracking:** Leveraging the CheapShark API, our application dynamically retrieves real-time pricing information from various platforms, ensuring users can access the best deals available.

**Data-Rich Game Information:** Harnessing the RAWG API, our system interfaces with an expansive database, offering detailed game metadata, including descriptions, genres, release dates, and ratings.

**YouTube API Integration:** Intertwining the YouTube API with RAWG, our application fetches and showcases game trailers, and reviews, providing an enriched user experience.

**Technical Insights:**

- **Frontend Architecture:** Developed using React.

- **Backend Logic with Node.js:** Developed using NodeJs.

- **API Communication:** The application integrates and communicates with the RAWG and CheapShark APIs for game-related data and pricing, respectively, while the YouTube API fetches video content seamlessly.

- **Search and Filtering Mechanisms:** Implements a robust search functionality for users to discover games based on titles, genres, and other relevant filters, providing a comprehensive exploration experience.

**Usage Guide:**

- **API Keys Configuration:** Developers need to configure API keys from RAWG, CheapShark, and YouTube for seamless functionality.
- **Building and Running the Application:** For now, run npm start on root, and client folder.

This repository serves as the foundation for an application that empowers users to explore and access PC games at optimized prices, offering detailed information and video content, all within a single platform.
